# Web CV

The purpose of this project is to showcase my current software development skills and advance them at the same time. My aim is to start with the front end functionality, then the styling, and then try my hand at back-end.

The current tech stack is the following:

- Node.js
- React
- Typescript
- Tailwind

The philosophy for this project is modularity, readability and stability. I decided not to use a component library to remove unnecessary bloating and to give myself more learning opportunities in designing every gear of this machine myself.

## Installation

- Clone the project
